## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: EchoQuest  
- **Category**: gaming  

### Description
**EchoQuest** is a cooperative rhythm-adventure game powered by the **Soundness Layer Testnet**.  

Players control **Echo Avatars (NFTs)** with sound-based abilities. Every action (attack, defense, buff) is triggered through rhythm inputs or skill cards. Teams of 3–5 players can form raids, where outcomes—scores, loot drops, and progression—are computed off-chain but **zk-proof verified on-chain**.  

**Key solutions**:  
- Multiplayer games often rely on centralized servers for scoring/loot → EchoQuest ensures **provable fairness**.  
- Loot distribution is usually opaque → every rarity and reward can be **zk-verified**.  
- Full on-chain gameplay is too expensive → EchoQuest leverages **off-chain zk-computation + on-chain proof verification** for efficiency.

## SL Integration
- **zk-Proof Verification** → each raid produces zk-proofs validating scores and loot distribution.  
- **SL RPC** → for minting Echo Avatars (ERC-721), item NFTs (ERC-1155), and reward settlements.  
- **Identity Layer** → ensures unique players in raids and prevents bots from inflating leaderboards.  
- **On-chain Events** → tournaments, loot settlement, and seasonal rewards are fully auditable.

## Technical

### Architecture

**Core Components**:  
- **Frontend** → Web app (React/Next.js) for marketplace & lobby, optional Unity client for rhythm gameplay.  
- **Backend API** → Handles matchmaking, raid orchestration, and proof submission.  
- **zk-Proof Engine** → Off-chain raid logic & scoring, generates zk-proofs for outcomes.  
- **Contracts** → Avatar NFTs, Item NFTs, Marketplace, Tournament Vaults, Verifier contracts.  
- **Storage** → IPFS/WALRUS for avatar metadata, replay hashes, and assets.  

### Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Next.js (marketplace/lobby), Unity (real-time gameplay)  
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express/Koa) or FastAPI (Python)  
- **zk**: Circom + SnarkJS / Halo2 / Cairo (depending on SL tooling)  
- **Blockchain**: Soundness Layer Testnet  
- **Storage**: IPFS + WALRUS for metadata & raid replays  

### Features
1. **Echo Avatars (NFTs)** → mint, customize, and upgrade sound-powered characters.  
2. **Co-op Raids** → 3–5 players battle bosses with rhythm-based mechanics.  
3. **zk-Verified Loot** → rare drops and scoring verified on-chain.  
4. **Replay Hashing** → each raid produces an IPFS-stored replay hash tied to zk-proof.  
5. **Marketplace & Crafting** → trade and fuse items with verifiable rarity mechanics.  
6. **Seasonal Tournaments** → leaderboard and staking rewards settled on-chain.  
7. **Spectator Mode** → raid proofs + replay hashes viewable via SL explorer.

## Timeline

### PoC (3 weeks)
- Basic ERC-721 Avatar + zk-proof verifier contract.  
- Minimal backend (simple raid + proof generation).  
- UI: mint avatars, join raid, verify outcome.  

### Alpha (6–10 weeks)
- Unity integration for rhythm mechanics.  
- Full raid mode (3–5 players).  
- Item NFTs + basic marketplace.  
- Internal playtests & feedback loop.  

### Beta (8–12 weeks)
- Batch proof optimization for large raids.  
- Tournament system + staking leaderboard.  
- Public testnet launch & community demo.

## Innovation
EchoQuest introduces **Cooperative zk-Verified Gameplay**:  
- **Team-based Proofs** → aggregate zk-proofs validate multi-player raid results.  
- **Replay + Proof Pairing** → players can audit raids by comparing replay hash with proof.  
- **Hybrid Gameplay** → combines low-latency Unity client with on-chain verified economy.  
- **Craft-to-Prove** → item upgrades use zk randomness so rarity outcomes are provable.  

This moves zk-gaming beyond simple duels into fully auditable **co-op multiplayer ecosystems**.
